# baby_names

Using baby name data from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-data-by-state-and-district-of-#topic=developers_navigation

Implement a "baby names as a service" (BNAAS) tool. This is the backend service that accepts input from a website and returns a result data set. The inputs are a name and a gender - or "both". Return the frequency of the name, per gender, for each year in the data set.
